Notes: How to  incorporate vaccines into the  if-else code? 
Effectiveness of vaccine * Infection rate = Infection rate of vaccinated individuals 
The vaccinated individuals have a different rate of infection than susceptible individuals so we need to assign different infecction rates
to each of the categories and then see how the vaccine affects rate
